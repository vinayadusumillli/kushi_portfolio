   - Removed transparent gradient text on h1 (was hard to read)

   - All headings now in bright, readable colors

2. **Body Text:**
   - Increased font size from 1rem to 1.05rem
   - Better line height (1.7) for easier reading
   - Brighter gray color (#C8D0DB instead of #A8B2C1)

### 🔍 **What Changed:**

### 🌐 **Refresh Your Browser:**
The Django server has automatically reloaded with the new CSS.

**Simply refresh your browser at: http://localhost:8000/**

Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (or **Cmd+Shift+R** on Mac) to force refresh and clear cache.

All text should now be much more visible and easier to read! 🎉
